All of these devices are potential security threats, and two have been involved in high-profile attacks.

\begin{description}
\item[EcoBee4:] While the Ecobee itself is not a high-wattage device, heating and cooling accounts for \%48 of the average American home’s energy consumption. A flaw in the remote operation could allow an adversary to synchronize a spike in power draw in a region, disrupting load balancing and causing blackouts.
\item[August Smart Lock Pro:] If an attack on a door lock becomes widely publicized, as happened to millions of hotel rooms in 2012, there is a clear financial incentive to use that attack for robbery. An August smart lock vulnerability was presented at DEFCON 2016.
\item[DAHUA 4MP IR WiFi 2.8mm Mini Bullet:] This camera was chosen because it is from a manufacturer whose cameras composed the majority of the Mirai botnet. Internet connected cameras are often used to violate the user’s privacy, as the existence of “insecam.org,” a website that displays insecure video feeds from around the world, attests to.
