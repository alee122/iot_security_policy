In order to ground this paper, each section will be summarized with a discussion of the ideas introduced in terms of three home IoT devices:
\begin{description}
\item[EcoBee4:] a smart thermostat with remote temperature sensors. \$249
\item[August Smart Lock Pro:] a door lock that grants access to owners of smartphones with the August app. Owners can grant and revoke access to other accounts. \$279
\item[DAHUA 4MP IR WiFi 2.8mm Mini Bullet:] a WiFi-enable security camera. \$119
\end{description}
All these devices can be controlled and monitored from anywhere in the world with internet access. The August can also be controlled via bluetooth connection. 

These devices use proprietary protocols rather than Zigbee, but the functionality of each could be provided by the Zigbee protocol. They are chosen instead for being either widely known or notorious.
